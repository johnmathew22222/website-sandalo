    <h3>Childhood Years</h3>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Childhood experiences are the best experiences for me. <sup>2</sup> I grew up in a peaceful
          neighborhood where every day felt like an adventure. <sup>3</sup> I always play basketball with our
          neighbor, I remember when I used to jump the fence just to play basketball with our
          neighbor. <sup>4</sup> Mornings started with my mom calling me for breakfast, usually pandesal and I
          always dip my pandesal to coffee of my lolo and lola before I ran outside to play. <sup>5</sup> I spent
          hours riding my bike, pretending the streets were a racetrack. <sup>6</sup> I don’t have much friend in
          our place but I enjoyed my childhood because of my classmates. <sup>7</sup> After class, we are always
          playing pogs, taya tayaan, agawan base, and etc in the waiting shed before my mom pick
          me up from school. <sup>8</sup> Rainy days meant staying inside, building forts with blankets and
          watching cartoons. <sup>9</sup> I remember getting excited about new toys, only to break them within
          days from playing too hard. <sup>10</sup> School was sometimes boring, but I loved recess because we
          have a tray of foods and me and my classmates running fast just to return the tray in the
          canteen. <sup>11</sup> I got in trouble a few times for talking too much in class, but I couldn’t help it, I
          had too many stories to tell. <sup>12</sup> I remember when I was a kid I always get bitten by our dog
          his name is dags because me and my tita are always playing outside while the dogs are
          eating and I always get hit by it. <sup>13</sup> In school, I am so competitive because we have a section
          in our school which is the highest of all and it is called “fast learner”, I am always in the top
          10 students. <sup>14</sup> When I was a kid I collect nerf guns and it’s memorable for me because I
          always lost my ammo in my nerf gun and we always buy in the mall. <sup>15</sup> Every Sunday morning
          we go to church and after we always go to mcdo or Jollibee. <sup>16</sup> I don’t have a father that’s
          why my grandfather always accompanies me to the mall, when eating, when playing
          timezone, and jogging in cubao, but after he died it's like my world stopped because we are
          always together no matter what happens that’s why I miss my lolo now. <sup>17</sup> As I got older, I
          started realizing that childhood wouldn’t last forever. <sup>18</sup> Some of my favorite places, like the
          old candy store, eventually disappeared. <sup>19</sup> I had to say goodbye to childhood pets and favorite
          toys, but the memories stayed. <sup>20</sup> Even now, I sometimes miss those carefree days when my
          biggest worry was finishing my homework on time.</blockquote>

    <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Becoming a teenager felt like stepping into a new world. <sup>2</sup> I went from worrying
          about toys to stressing over school, friends, and what the future held. <sup>3</sup> High school was a
          mix of excitement and frustration, filled with late-night studying and early-morning alarms.
          <sup>4</sup> I remember my first day in highschool I was so shy because it feels like im in a new
          environment. <sup>5</sup> Fast forward, I remember my first big test I thought I studied enough, but
          my grade said otherwise. <sup>6</sup> Sports became a big part of my life, and I spent hours practicing,
          hoping to make the team but I didn’t be a part of varsity basketball. <sup>7</sup> After i heard the news
          about who is in the varsity team and I heard that I wasn’t included in the list, I cried so
          hard in the house even in the school because I was so disappointed because I wanted to
          be a part of basketball team in our school. <sup>8</sup> Friendships changed, and I realized that not
          everyone I grew up with would stay in my life. <sup>9</sup> I experienced my first real argument with a
          close friend, and it hurt more than I expected. <sup>10</sup> Crushes and awkward conversations became
          part of my daily routine, I remembered my first ex girlfriend that her family don’t want me
          because they heard me say bad words and I’m so disappointed with myself and I was so
          shy that I don’t want them to see me again. <sup>11</sup> I’ll never forget the nerves of my first school
          dance, standing in the corner, unsure of what to do. <sup>12</sup> Getting my first phone felt like a huge
          deal, even if my parents set way too many rules on it. <sup>13</sup> We always go to church as usual
          every Sunday and we always eat dinner after. <sup>14</sup> I will never forget in my highschool days that
          I got called by the prefect of discipline because i invited to a fight a 3 boys in our school
          because I was an arrogant student back then. <sup>15</sup> I enjoyed in our school because it’s my first
          time joining in the retreat and we shared our thoughts there together with my classmates.
          <sup>16</sup> We had a fieldtrip back then and we go to zoo and other places and there’s one time that
          we had a fieldtrip and we swim. <sup>17</sup> In highschool, There were moments when I felt on top of
          the world, and others where I doubted myself completely. <sup>18</sup> Some days, I just wanted to be
          a kid again, free from expectations and pressure. <sup>19</sup>But through every challenge, I slowly
          figured out who I was and what I wanted. <sup>20</sup> Looking back, my teenage years were a mix of
          mistakes, lessons, and unforgettable memories that shaped me into the person I am today.

      <h3>College Years</h3>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> College life at the University of the East has been a rollercoaster of experiences.
            <sup>2</sup> As a 2nd-year BSIT student, I’ve had my countless of sleepless nights, rushing deadlines,
            and unexpected challenges. <sup>3</sup> Adjusting to college was tough at first, but I slowly found my
            rhythm. <sup>4</sup> I spent countless hours learning code, sometimes feeling frustrated but always
            pushing through, but to be honest im not that good in coding, I don’t know how to make a
            code if I don’t rely on the modules and in the internet. <sup>5</sup> Group projects tested my patience,
            especially when some members didn’t contribute as much as they should. <sup>6</sup> One of the biggest
            disappointments was not making the basketball team for the CCSS sports fest. <sup>7</sup> I worked
            hard, but they prioritized 4th-year students, and it felt unfair. <sup>8</sup> Despite the setback, I still
            played basketball whenever I could, enjoying the game even without a team. <sup>9</sup> However, my
            love for the sport came at a cost when I developed water in my right lung. <sup>10</sup> The surgery that
            followed was one of the scariest moments of my life. <sup>11</sup> Recovering was tough, but it taught
            me resilience and the importance of taking care of my body. <sup>12</sup> Last sem, I almost couldn't
            take the exam because I was confined in hospital because I was dehydrated and I passed
            out in the LRT when I was on my way to school. <sup>13</sup> Even with these struggles, college has
            given me great memories. <sup>14</sup> I’ve met amazing friends who make the stress bearable with latenight study sessions and random food trips. <sup>15</sup> When I was a first year we always play billiards
            when we have a vacant, but now we don’t have much time because we are loaded in
            subjects. <sup>16</sup> University of the east wasn’t my first choice in school but Im thankful because
            here I met my girlfriend now. <sup>17</sup> There are days when the pressure feels overwhelming, but I
            remind myself why I started. <sup>18</sup> College isn’t just about grades it’s about growth, setbacks,
            and finding my own path. <sup>19</sup> Despite everything, I know I became stronger, both as a student
            and as a person. <sup>20</sup> I want to finish my studies because I want to have a successful life and I
            want to give back to my mother because of her hardwork, I will not be able to study and
            have a good life.
